r0: is zero
r1: holds the return address
r2: call stack pointer
r3: value stack pointer
r4: nonvolatile register (if used, must save & restore)
r5: volatile register 
r6: temporary register
r7: temporary register

/* * * * * * * * * * Correctly Implemented * * * * * * * * * */

Our code passes our tests so it is correct to our knowledge.


/* * * * * * * * * Departures from Calling Convention * * * * * * * * */

r3 is used as a RPN value stack pointer.


/* * * * * * * * * * Architecture * * * * * * * * * */

The print module is a recursive function that takes 1 argument and outputs 
one digit at a time, starting from the leftmost digit.

The RPN value stack is a stack initialized in the calc40.ums file and is 
pointed to by r3 (it's different from the call stack initialized in urt0.ums).


/* * * * * * * * * * Sections Used * * * * * * * * * */

text: contains code, including the implementation of procedure functions
    and the main driver function.

data: allocates space for data structures used - the call stack and RPN 
    value stack.

init: initializes both the call stack & RPN value stack pointers, sets
    r0 to equal to 0 and initializes addresses for the jumptable.
